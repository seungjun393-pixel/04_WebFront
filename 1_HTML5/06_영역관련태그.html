  <h1>영역을 나누는 형식(성질)</h1>

  <pre>
<h3>block 형식</h3>
- 항상 새로운 줄에서 시작
- 이전 요소의 아래에 위치(블럭이 아래로 쌓임)    
- 크기를 지정하는 width, height 속성을 사용할 수 있음

ex) p/pre (문단 나누기), h1 ~ h6 (제목 영역 나누기)
    hr (수평선 사용해서 화면 나누기), u1, ol, li (목록)
    div (영역 나누기)
  </pre>

  <pre>
<h3>inline 형식</h3>
- 동일한 줄에 다른 inline 요소와 나란히 배치
- 크기를 지정하는 width, height 속성을 사용할 수 없음
(콘텐츠의 너비만큼 차지)

ex) strong/b, em/i, mark, span(한줄을 나누는 용도)
  </pre>

  <hr>

  <h2>block(div) / inline(span) 차이점 1 : 줄바꿈(개행)</h2>

  <h3>div 태그</h3>
  <p>
    block 형식의 태그는 한 줄을 모두 차지하기 때문에<br>
    뒤에오는 내용은 다음줄에 작성이 된다.
  </p>

  <div>첫번째 영역</div>
  <div>두번째 영역</div>
  <div>세번째 영역</div>

  <hr>

  <h3>span 태그</h3>
  <p>
    inline 형식 태그는 한 줄 내에서 일정한 칸을 차지하기 때문에<br>
    뒤에오는 내용은 줄이 바뀌지 않고 옆에 붙어 출력된다.
  </p>

  <span>첫번째 영역</span>
  <span>두번째 영역</span>
  <span>세번째 영역</span>

  <hr>

  <h2>block(div) / inline(span) 차이점 2  : 영역 지정 방식</h2>

    I had a bad week
    Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep<br>
    You could see in my eyes that it was taking over<br>
    I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment<br>
    You know you take all of my stress right down<br>
    Help me get it off my chest and out<br>
    Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed<br>
    We forget that we're here right now<br>
    'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race<br>
    Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change<br>
    We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn<br>
    If we're missin' out on what the people think is right<br>
    Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be<br>
    Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read<br>
    I think maybe you and me<br>
    Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays<br>
    And then we'll go all night<br>
    Two-steppin' with the woman I love<br>
    All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified<br>
    We'll keep turnin' up and go all night<br>
    Oh, we had dips and falls in our time<br>
    But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved<br>
    And all we need is us to go all<br>
    Night, night<br>
    Two-steppin' with the woman I love<br>
    Night, yeah<br>
    All we need is us<br>
    We can stay up to the sunrise, get in the late night<br>
    Just you and me, don't have to be shy, baby<br>
    Don't be shy, babe<br>
    It's a time like this, baby<br>
    Feel my mind with the kiss, I'm in bliss<br>
    Yeah, this is heaven, baby<br>
    And I don't wanna miss what we have right now<br>
    So, tell me, would you stay up (stay up) late night?<br>
    Talking 'til we make trust (make trust)<br>
    Baby, tell me, would you be the one, be my one? (Be the one)<br>
    We'll go all night<br>
    Two-steppin' with the woman I love (two-steppin' with the woman I love)<br>
    All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, (yeah) electrified<br>
    We'll keep turnin' up and go all night (all night)<br>
    Yeah, we had dips and falls in our time<br>
    But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved (but we know what it feels like)<br>
    And all we need is us to go all<br>
    Night, night<br>
    Two-steppin' with the woman I love (two-steppin', yeah)<br>
    Night, yeah<br>
    All we need is us to go all night<br>
    Night, night (all night)<br>
    Two-steppin' with the woman I love (two-steppin', yeah)<br>
    Night, yeah<br>
